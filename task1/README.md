**Student Score Prediction**

Project Overview:
This project predicts student scores based on study hours using machine learning models. It demonstrates regression techniques to model the relationship between study hours and exam scores, providing insights into performance prediction.

**Features**

Predict student scores based on input study hours.

Compare multiple regression models (Linear and Polynomial Regression).

Evaluate models using metrics like R², RMSE, and MAE.

Visualize data distribution and regression lines for better understanding.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

seaborn (optional for enhanced visualization)

**Models Used**

Linear Regression

Captures a linear relationship between study hours and scores.

Metrics:

R² (Coefficient of Determination)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)

Captures non-linear relationships for more accurate predictions.

Metrics:

R²

RMSE

MAE

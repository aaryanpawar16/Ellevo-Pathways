Loan Approval Prediction

Project Overview:
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details using machine learning classification models. It helps banks and financial institutions automate and improve decision-making while reducing human bias.

Features

Predict loan approval status based on applicant information.

Compare multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Handle missing data, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.

Visualize feature importance to understand key factors influencing approval.

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Binary classification to predict loan approval.

Provides probability scores for approval.

Decision Tree Classifier

Tree-based model capturing non-linear decision boundaries.

Easy to interpret with visual decision paths.

Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Feature importance identifies key factors affecting loan approval.

Requirements

Python 3.x

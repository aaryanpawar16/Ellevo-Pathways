Customer Segmentation

Project Overview:
This project performs customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and other attributes. It helps businesses understand customer patterns and target marketing strategies effectively.

Features

Segment customers into meaningful clusters.

Analyze customer behavior and spending patterns.

Compare clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN).

Visualize clusters using 2D and 3D plots.

Extract actionable insights for business strategies.

Algorithms Used

K-Means Clustering

Partitions customers into k clusters based on similarity.

Determines cluster centers and assigns customers accordingly.

Outputs cluster centers and labels for each customer.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

Groups customers based on density of points.

Identifies outliers as noise.

Useful when clusters are irregular or vary in size.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

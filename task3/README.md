Forest Cover Type Classification

Project Overview:
This project predicts the forest cover type (e.g., spruce, pine, aspen) based on cartographic variables. It demonstrates the use of machine learning classification algorithms to analyze environmental data and make predictions about forest composition.

Features

Predict forest cover type based on environmental and geographic features.

Compare performance of multiple classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, etc.).

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize feature importance and data distribution.

Models Used

Random Forest

Ensemble method using multiple decision trees.

Provides feature importance scores.

Achieves high accuracy on structured tabular data.

Gradient Boosting

Boosting ensemble method that reduces bias and improves predictions.

Strong performance for imbalanced classes.

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Separates classes using hyperplanes in higher dimensions.

Effective for smaller datasets or non-linear decision boundaries.
